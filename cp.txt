Here's a basic representation of the ERM using Crow's Foot notation:


__________________              __________________           ____________________
| Gymnasium      |            | Session        |         | Coach            |

In this model:

PK indicates Primary Key.
FK indicates Foreign Key.
The relationships are shown using the Crow's Foot notation:

1 to M (one to many) relationship between Gymnasium and Session (a gymnasium can have multiple sessions, but each session is associated with one gymnasium).
1 to M relationship between Session and Coach (a session can have one or two coaches, but each coach can conduct multiple sessions).
1 to M relationship between Member and Registration (a member can register for multiple sessions, but each registration is for one member).
M to 1 relationship between Session and Registration (each session can have multiple registrations, but each registration is for one session).

This ERM provides a basic structure for managing gymnasiums, members, sessions, and coaches in a relational database system.
